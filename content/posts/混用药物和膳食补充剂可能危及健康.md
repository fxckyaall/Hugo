Dietary supplements may contain ingredients that can have strong effects in the body. Talk with a health care professional before taking supplements.  
膳食补充剂可能含有对身体产生强烈影响的成分。在服用补充剂之前，请与医疗保健专业人士交谈。
<!--more-->

When you take prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications, do you also take a vitamin, mineral, or other dietary supplement? Have you considered whether there is any danger in mixing medications and dietary supplements?  
当您服用处方药或非处方药（OTC）时，您是否也服用维生素、矿物质或其他膳食补充剂？您是否考虑过混用药物和膳食补充剂是否存在危险？

There could be. Certain dietary supplements can change absorption, metabolism, or excretion of a medication. If that happens, it can affect the potency of your medication, which means you may get either too much or too little of the medication you need.  
这是有可能的。**某些膳食补充剂可能会改变药物的吸收、代谢或排泄。如果发生这种情况，它可能会影响您药物的效力，这意味着您摄入药物的效力可能变强或变弱。**

## 混用药物和膳食补充剂的危险

Dietary supplements are widely used and include vitamins, minerals, and other less familiar substances—such as amino acids, botanicals, and botanical-derived ingredients. Tens of millions of people in the U.S. take some kind of dietary supplement along with a prescription medication.  
膳食补充剂被广泛使用，包括维生素、矿物质和其他或许您不太熟悉的物质，如氨基酸、植物成分和植物衍生成分。美国有数千万人在服用处方药的同时也服用某种膳食补充剂。

Combining dietary supplements and medications could have dangerous and even life-threatening effects. For example, drugs for HIV/AIDS, heart disease, depression, treatments for organ transplants, and birth control pills are less effective when taken with St. John’s wort, an herbal supplement. Depending on the medication involved, the results can be serious.  
混用膳食补充剂和药物可能会产生危险甚至危及生命的影响。例如，艾滋病、心脏病、抑郁症药物，及器官移植治疗药物和避孕药等，在与草本补充剂“圣约翰草”一起服用时效果会变差。根据涉及的药物不同，结果可能会很严重。

In addition, warfarin (a prescription blood thinner), ginkgo biloba (an herbal supplement), aspirin, and vitamin E (a supplement) can each thin the blood. Taking any of these products together may increase the potential for internal bleeding or stroke.  
此外，华法林（处方抗凝血剂）、银杏叶提取物（草药补充剂）、阿司匹林和维生素E（补充剂）都可能使血液变稀。同时服用这些产品可能增加内出血或中风的风险。

_Don’t Assume “Natural” Means Safe  
不要假设“自然”就意味着安全_

Some consumers may believe that a so-called “natural” product, such as an herbal supplement or fish oil, can’t hurt them. Natural does not always mean safe.  
一些消费者可能会认为所谓的“天然”产品，比如草药补充剂或鱼油，不会对他们造成伤害。但是天然并不总是安全的。

For example, many weight loss products claim to be “all-natural” or “herbal,” but their ingredients may interact with medications or may be dangerous for people with certain medical conditions.  
例如，许多减肥产品声称是“全天然”或“草药”，但它们的成分可能会与药物相互作用，或者对某些特定医疗条件的人有危险。

_Precautions for Children and for Those Who Are Pregnant or Breastfeeding  
对儿童以及怀孕或哺乳期消费者的注意事项_

Children, in particular, could be harmed by taking both supplements and medicines. Children’s metabolisms are unique, and at different ages they metabolize substances at different rates. For kids, ingesting dietary supplements together with other medications make adverse events a real possibility. And if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, you’ll want to discuss any dietary supplements with their health care professional.  
儿童如果同时服用补充剂和药物，尤其可能会受到伤害。儿童的新陈代谢是独特的，不同年龄段的儿童代谢物质的速率也不同。对于儿童来说，与其他药物一起摄入膳食补充剂可能会导致不良事件发生。如果您怀孕或在哺乳期，在服用任何膳食补充剂之前，您应该与医疗保健专业人员沟通。

_Considerations Before Surgery  
手术前的考虑事项_

If you’re planning a surgery, be aware that some dietary supplements can interact in a harmful way with medications you need to take before, after, or during that surgery. Your health care professional may ask you to stop taking dietary supplements two or three weeks before the procedure to avoid potentially dangerous changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or bleeding risk.  
如果您计划进行手术，请注意一些膳食补充剂可能会与您在手术之前、之后或期间需要服用的药物产生有害相互作用。您的医疗保健专业人员可能会要求您在手术前两到三周停止服用膳食补充剂，以避免心率、血压或出血风险潜在危险的变化。

## FDA 在膳食补充剂中的作用

Although the FDA has oversight of the dietary supplement industry, the supplement manufacturers and distributors are responsible for making sure their products are safe before they’re marketed. Manufacturers are required to produce dietary supplements that meet minimum quality standards, do not contain contaminants or impurities, and are accurately labeled.  
尽管FDA对膳食补充剂行业进行监管，但补充剂制造商和分销商有责任确保其产品在上市前是安全的。制造商必须生产符合最低质量标准、不含污染物或杂质、并标签准确的膳食补充剂。

The FDA does not review supplements for effectiveness (as it does for OTC and prescription medications) before they enter the market. If the dietary supplement contains certain new dietary ingredients, the manufacturer must submit data on that ingredient’s safety—but not its effectiveness—for the FDA’s review before the manufacturer markets a dietary supplement containing the ingredient.  
FDA在膳食补充剂进入市场之前不会像对待非处方药和处方药一样对其进行有效性审查。如果膳食补充剂含有某些新的膳食成分（NDI），制造商必须在推出含有该成分的膳食补充剂之前提交有关该成分安全性的数据，但不包括其有效性，以供美国食品药品监督管理局审查。

The FDA can take enforcement actions against manufacturers if their products are found to be adulterated (for example, if an ingredient is unsafe) and/or misbranded (for example, if their labeling is false or misleading). To the extent a product marketed as a dietary supplement bears claims that the product is intended to diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent a disease, the FDA may also consider whether it is appropriate to take action against products that are unlawfully marketed as drugs.  
如果发现产品被掺假（例如，如果某种成分不安全）和/或标签不实（例如，如果其标签虚假或误导），FDA可以对其制造商采取执法行动。在某种程度上，如果作为膳食补充剂销售的产品声称该产品旨在诊断、缓解、治疗、治愈或预防疾病，FDA还可能考虑是否适当采取行动针对非法作为药品销售的产品。

## 使用补充剂之前请咨询医疗保健专业人士

Before you take any dietary supplement or medication—over-the-counter or prescription—it is important to discuss it with your health care professional.  
在您服用任何膳食补充剂或药物（非处方或处方药）之前，重要的是与您的医疗保健专业人士讨论。

- Every time you visit a health care professional’s office, bring a list of all the dietary supplements and medications you are currently taking. Include the dosages and how many times a day you take them. Some people find it easiest to throw all their dietary supplements and medications in a bag to bring to the medical visit.  
    每次您去看医生时，请带上您目前正在服用的所有膳食补充剂和药物清单。包括剂量和每天服用次数。有些人发现最简单的方法是把所有的膳食补充剂和药物都放在一个袋子里带到医疗访问中。
- If you’re thinking of adding a dietary supplement to your daily routine, call your health care professional first, and let them know what other supplements and medications you’re taking.  
    如果您考虑将膳食补充剂加入日常饮食中，请先致电您的医疗保健专业人士，并告知他们您正在服用的其他补充剂和药物。
- Also, tell your health care professional if your health status has changed, particularly if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have had any recent illnesses or surgery.  
    另外，如果您的健康状况发生变化，特别是如果您怀孕、在哺乳期，或最近有任何疾病或手术，请告诉您的医疗保健专业人员。
